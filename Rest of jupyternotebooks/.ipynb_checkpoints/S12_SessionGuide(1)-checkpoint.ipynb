    "   - **Data Sparsity:** For the same number of data points, **as dimension increases, the the volume of the resulting space increases very fast making data very sparse**. This makes more difficult to find meaningful patterns in data due to the increasing combinatorics of the feature space. In order to obtain reliable results, the **number of samples must grow accordingly (that means exponentially)**, and the is not always possible (the amount of data is limited).\n",
    "   - **Distance Concentration:** This phenomenon occurs specialy with distance-based algorithms. The euclidean distance between two points in the space **tends to converge to the same value** when the number of dimensions increase. That is, the **concept of proximity is no longer relevant** when we try to find patterns on data based on distance.\n",
    "   - **Data Understanding:** The higher the dimension, the more complex the data and the more difficult to visualize it. In general, the simpler, the better (Occam's razor).\n",
    "   - **Overfitting:** Models trained in high dimensional data are easier to overfit. This is because data sparsity. The higher the dimension, the easier is to find a model that perfectly separates between the classes, but doesn't generalize well with unseen data.\n",
