    "This year's Group Assignment will verse on predicting employee attrition. The dataset is available on Kaggle: [Employee Attrition competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e3/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not (`Attrition` column, binary classification).\n",
    "* The dataset is artificially generated, but it is based on real data: [original data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)\n",
    "    * Here you can find what each feature represents and their possible values.\n",
    "* You're given a training set and a test set. \n",
    "    * Perform your analysis, experiments and model selection on the training set, and don't touch the test set until you're ready to submit your predictions.\n",
    "    * You can save some data from the training set to use as a validation set, but you should not use the test set for this purpose.\n",
    "    * Once you're comfortable with the performance of your model on the training set, you can use the test set to get a final estimate of the performance of your model.\n",
    "    * The CSV file that you will submit, should contain the predictions of your model on the test set. This means that the CSV should contain as many rows as the test set, and a single column with the predictions (0 or 1)."

    "  * If you just copy and paste, I will know and I will ask you about it, so be prepared.\n",
    "* The final submission should use any of the algorithms that we've seen during the course, so no neural networks or similar. There's will be a time for that, but not now.\n"
