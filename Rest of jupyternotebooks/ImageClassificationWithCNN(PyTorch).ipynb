A convolutional neural network is a kind of neural network that extracts *features* from matrices of numeric values (often images) by convolving multiple filters over the matrix values to apply weights and identify patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on in an image. The numeric representations of these patterns are then passed to a fully-connected neural network layer to map the features to specific classes.\n","\n","## Basic Neural Network Recap\n","\n","Your brain works by connecting networks of neurons, each of which receives electrochemical stimuli from multiple inputs, which cause the neuron to fire under certain conditions. When a neuron fires, it creates an electrochemical charge that is passed as an input to one or more other neurons, creating a complex *feed-forward* network made up of layers of neurons that pass the signal on. An artificial neural network uses the same principles but the inputs are numeric values with associated *weights* that reflect their relative importance. The neuron take these input values and weights and applies them to an *activation function* that determines the ouput that the artificial neuron passes onto the next layer:\n","\n","<br/>\n","<div align=\"center\" style='font-size:24px;'>&#8694;&#9711;&rarr;</div>\n","\n","As the human brain learns from experience, the inputs to the neurons are strenghtened or weakened depending on their importance to the decisions that the brain needs to make in response to stimuli. Similarly, you train an artificial neural network using a supervised leaning technique in which a *loss function* is used to evaluate how well the multi-layered model detects known labels. You can then find the derivative of the loss function to determine whether the level of error (loss) is reduced by increasing or decreasing the weights associated with the inputs, and then apply *backpropagation* to adjust the weights and improve the model iteratively over multiple training *epochs*. The result of this training is a deep learning model that consists of:\n","* An *input* layer to which the initial input variables are passed.\n","* One or more *hidden* layers in which the weights optimized by training determine the signal that is fed forward through the network.\n","* An *output* layer that presents the results.\n","\n","## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n","Convolutional Neural Networks, or *CNNs*, are a particular type of artificial neural network that works well with matrix inputs, such as images (which are fundamentally just multi-dimensional matrices of pixel intensity values). There are various kinds of layer in a CNN, but a common architecture is to build a sequence of *convolutional* layers that find patterns in indvidual areas of the input matrix and *pooling* layers that aggregate these patterns. Additionally, some layers may *drop* data (which helps avoid *overfitting* the model to the training data), and finally some layers will *flatten* the matrix data and a linear *dense*, or *fully connected* layer will perform classification and reshape the predictions to conform with the expected output format.\n","\n","Conceptually, a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification is made up of multiple layers that extract features, such as edges, corners, etc; followed by one or more fully-connected layers to classify objects based on these features. You can visualize this like this:\n","\n","<table>\n","    <tr><td rowspan=2 style='border: 1px solid black;'>&#x21d2;</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Convolutional Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Pooling Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Convolutional Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Pooling Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Drop Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Fully Connected Layer</td><td rowspan=2 style='border: 1px solid black;'>&#x21d2;</td></tr>\n","    <tr><td colspan=5 style='border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;'>Feature Extraction</td><td style='border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;'>Classification</td></tr>\n","</table>\n","\n","*Note: In Machine Learning, particularly \"deep learning\", matrices used in neural networks are often referred to as **tensors**.

In some deep learning frameworks, like PyTorch, a tensor is a specific type of data structure with properties and methods that support deep learning operations.*\n","\n","### Convolutional Layers\n","Convolutional layers apply filters to a subregion of the input image, and *convolve* the filter across the image to extract features (such as edges, corners, etc.).

To create a fully-connected layer, the feature maps are flattened into a single 1-dimensional matrix and a function is applied to calculate the probability for each class that the model is designed to predict - usually this final function is a *Sigmoid* or *SoftMax* function that assigns a value between 0 and 1 to each class, with the total of these assignments adding to 1:\n","\n","$$\\begin{bmatrix}510 & 255 & 510\\\\255 & 0 & 255\\\\510 & 255 & 510\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}255 & 255 & 510\\\\255 & 0 & 255\\\\510 & 255 & 255\\end{bmatrix}...$$\n","\n","$$ \\Downarrow $$\n","\n","$$\\begin{bmatrix}510 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 0 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 0 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 255 ...\\end{bmatrix}$$\n","\n","$$ \\Downarrow $$\n","\n","$$\\begin{bmatrix}C_{1} & C_{2} & C_{3} \\\\ 0.15 & 0.8 & 0.05\\end{bmatrix}$$\n","\n","### Backpropagation\n","When we train a CNN, we perform mulitple passes forward through the network of layers, and then use a *loss function* to measure the difference between the output values (which you may recall are probability predictions for each class) and the actual values for the known image classes used to train the model (in other words, 1 for the correct class and 0 for all the others). For example, in the example above the predicted probabilities are 0.15 for C<sub>1</sub>, 0.8 for C<sub>2</sub>, and 0.05 for C<sub>3</sub>. Let's suppose that the image in question is an example of C<sub>2</sub>, so the expected output is actually 0 for C<sub>1</sub>, 1 for C<sub>2</sub>, and 0 for C<sub>3</sub>.

After each epoch, the loss function measures the error (*loss*) in the model and adjusts the weights (which were randomly generated for the first iteration) to try to improve accuracy. \n","\n","> **Note**: We're only using 5 epochs to reduce the training time for this simple example. A real-world CNN is usually trained over more epochs than this. CNN model training is processor-intensive, so it's recommended to perform this on a system that can leverage GPUs (such as the Data Science Virtual Machine in Azure) to reduce training time. Status will be displayed as the training progresses."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BoYR_dnRryXX","outputId":"65293a47-845b-47e6-e8cb-ed71973042ba"},"source":["def train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch):\n","    # Set the model to training mode\n","    model.train()\n","    train_loss = 0\n","    print(\"Epoch:\", epoch)\n","    # Process the images in batches\n","    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):\n","        # Use the CPU or GPU as appropriate\n","        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\n","        \n","        # Reset the optimizer\n","        optimizer.zero_grad()\n","        \n","        # Push the data forward through the model layers\n","        output = model(data)\n","        \n","        # Get the loss\n","        loss = loss_criteria(output, target)\n","\n","        # Keep a running total\n","        train_loss += loss.item()\n","        \n","        # Backpropagate\n","        loss.backward()\n","        optimizer.step()\n","        \n","        # Print metrics so we see some progress\n","        print('\\tTraining batch {} Loss: {:.6f}'.format(batch_idx + 1, loss.item()))\n","            \n","    # return average loss for the epoch\n","    avg_loss = train_loss / (batch_idx+1)\n","    print('Training set: Average loss: {:.6f}'.format(avg_loss))\n","    return avg_loss\n","            \n","            \n","def test(model, device, test_loader):\n","    # Switch the model to evaluation mode (so we don't backpropagate or drop)\n","    model.eval()\n","    test_loss = 0\n","    correct = 0\n","    with torch.no_grad():\n","        batch_count = 0\n","        for data, target in test_loader:\n","            batch_count += 1\n","            data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\n","            \n","            # Get the predicted classes for this batch\n","            output = model(data)\n","            \n","            # Calculate the loss for this batch\n","            test_loss += loss_criteria(output, target).item()\n","            \n","            # Calculate the accuracy for this batch\n","            _, predicted = torch.max(output.data, 1)\n","            correct += torch.sum(target==predicted).item()\n","\n","    # Calculate the average loss and total accuracy for this epoch\n","    avg_loss = test_loss / batch_count\n","    print('Validation set: Average loss: {:.6f}, Accuracy: {}/{} ({:.0f}%)\\n'.format(\n","        avg_loss, correct, len(test_loader.dataset),\n","        100. * correct / len(test_loader.dataset)))\n","    \n","    # return average loss for the epoch\n","    return avg_loss\n","    \n","    \n","# Use an \"Adam\" optimizer to adjust weights\n","optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n","\n","# Specify the loss criteria\n","loss_criteria = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n","\n","# Track metrics in these arrays\n","epoch_nums = []\n","training_loss = []\n","validation_loss = []\n","\n","# Train over 5 epochs (in a real scenario, you'd likely use many more)\n","epochs = 5\n","print('Training on', device)\n","for epoch in range(1, epochs + 1):\n","        train_loss = train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch)\n","        test_loss = test(model, device, test_loader)\n","        epoch_nums.append(epoch)\n","        training_loss.append(train_loss)\n","        validation_loss.append(test_loss)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Training on cpu\n","Epoch: 1\n","\tTraining batch 1 Loss: 1.126580\n","\tTraining batch 2 Loss: 10.986751\n","\tTraining batch 3 Loss: 7.096817\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sjLVH9kUryXY"},"source":["### View the Loss History\n","We tracked average training and validation loss for each epoch.
